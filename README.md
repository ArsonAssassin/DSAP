* Optional: edit the yaml setting to your preference
* Either run Generate.py or press the Generate button on the launcher to generate a seed.
* When this has completed, you will have a zip file in your Archipelago/Output folder.
* Host this zip either using the Host option on the launcher or by uploading it to Archipelago.gg
* Run the game, and **load into your save file**.
* With both the Archipelago server and game running, Open the client folder you unzipped earlier and run DSAP.Desktop.exe.
* Fill in your host, slot and password (if required) and press Connect. This will cause your game to reload.
* You should now be ready to play.

# Known issues
* If you receive an item while on the main menu, it may get lost, requiring admin intervention. For safety, you should only run the client once loaded into game.
  * Furthermore, you should close the client before quitting to menu or quitting the game.
* Deathlink has not been thoroughly tested.
